# Challenges in Mastering Data Structures & Sorting Algorithms

## Overview
this doc outlines the primary challenges I encountered while exploring various data structures & sorting algo on Visualgo.net certain concepts & implementations remain difficult to fully grasp, below are the key areas where I continue to face challenges & have not yet mastered the material.

## Challenges

1. **Advanced Graph Algorithms**
challenge: Understanding complex algorithms like Dijkstra's, Bellman-Ford, & A* for shortest path calculations
reason: these algorithms require advanced graph management, priority queues, & handling negative weights, making them challenging to implement.
2. **Dynamic Programming**
challenge: Mastering techniques like memoization & tabulation for problems like the Knapsack Problem.
reason: Breaking down problems into subproblems & deciding between greedy algorithms & dynamic programming is conceptually difficult.
3. **Segment and Fenwick Trees**
challenge: Performing range queries and updates efficiently.
reason: These trees involve complex indexing and updating strategies that are hard to master.
4. **N-Body Problem and Computational Geometry**
challenge: Solving geometric problems like convex hulls.
reason: These problems require a strong understanding of both mathematical principles and advanced data structures.
5. **Multithreading and Concurrency**
challenge: Managing threads and avoiding race conditions in multithreaded algorithms.
reason: Synchronizing threads and ensuring correct execution without conflicts is difficult to implement and debug.
